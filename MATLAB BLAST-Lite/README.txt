Run the script 'simulate_battery_aging.m' in MATLAB r2020b (or later version) to simulate battery lifetime. Battery life has three inputs: battery chemistry, climate, and the application. The stress on the battery is due to both climate and application.
Climate is picked from annual temperature data recorded for the 100 most populous U.S. regional airports.
Application profiles are uploaded by the user into the 'Application profiles' folder. Some preloaded stationary storage and mobile application profiles are provided. Users can upload any arbitrary application profiles as a '.csv' file. Application profiles should have two columns: 'tsecs', the time in seconds, and 'soc', the state-of-charge of the battery. Ensure the start and end state-of-charge of the battery are within 1% for an accurate life simulation.
Temperature management of the battery system can be turned on or off. The simplistic temperature management system assumes a maximum and minimum battery temperature when the battery is being used (charged or discharged). These maximum and minimum limits are defined by the user. Battery temperature during rest is assumed to be equal to ambient.
Simulation results are plotted as figures and automatically written to an excel file, saved in the 'Simulation results' folder.
